A set of tools to:
 - search NCBI's pubmed articles through straight text queries,
 - get articles related to nucleotide polymorphisms found on target gene via dbSNP,
 - get articles contained inside a page (polymorphism or gene) on SNPedia,
 - view a summary of articles gathered on those searches.


Note: Designed for python3; requires wikitools [py3 branch] from github, as wikitools version from pypi is broken for python 3.
